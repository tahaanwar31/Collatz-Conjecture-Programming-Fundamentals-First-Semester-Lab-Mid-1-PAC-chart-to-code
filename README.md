# Collatz-Conjecture-Programming-Fundamentals-First-Semester-Lab-Mid-1-PAC-chart-to-code


In this program, I was required to implement the Collatz Conjecture algorithm as part of the Programming Fundamentals Lab Mid 1 in the first semester at FAST NUCES. The task involved writing a program that takes a starting number as input and calculates how many steps are needed to reduce the number to 1, following a specific set of rules.

The rules are simple:

If the number is even, it is divided by 2.
If the number is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and incremented by 1.
The program keeps applying these rules in a loop until the number becomes 1. I used a while loop to repeatedly modify the number, and each time the loop runs, a counter keeps track of the number of steps taken. Finally, the program outputs the total number of steps it took to reach 1.

This question tested my understanding of loops, conditional statements, and basic algorithm design
